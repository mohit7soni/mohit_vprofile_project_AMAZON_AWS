🔧 1. DNS Zones (Public - GoDaddy)
GoDaddy is used to purchase and manage the domain name (e.g., www.yourdomain.com).

It maps the domain to the Application Load Balancer (ALB)'s endpoint using DNS.

👥 2. Users
End users access the application via HTTPS (https://yourdomain.com).

Requests are securely routed over SSL/TLS.

⚖️ 3. Application Load Balancer (ALB)
Receives HTTPS traffic from users.

Associated with a Security Group that allows traffic on port 443 (HTTPS).

It forwards the traffic internally to the Tomcat application servers on port 8080 (HTTP).

🚀 4. Auto Scaling Group of Tomcat Instances
These EC2 instances are running Tomcat, where your web application is deployed.

Auto Scaling ensures high availability and scalability by adjusting the number of instances based on traffic.

Protected by a Security Group to allow incoming traffic only from the ALB (on port 8080).

🛡️ 5. Application Layer Security Groups
Security groups are used at different layers to control inbound and outbound traffic for:

ALB

Tomcat Instances

Backend Services (MySQL, RabbitMQ, Memcached)

🧠 6. Backend Layer
a. MySQL
Stores relational data (e.g., user details, transactions).

Tomcat connects to MySQL to perform DB operations.

b. RabbitMQ
A message broker used for asynchronous communication between services (e.g., task queues, notifications).

Tomcat can publish tasks to RabbitMQ for background processing.

c. Memcached
In-memory caching layer to reduce database load and increase performance.

Used to store session data or frequently accessed queries.

All these are protected within their own Security Group, which restricts access only to the necessary components.

🌐 7. Amazon Route 53 (Private Hosted Zone)
Private DNS zones allow internal name resolution within the VPC.

Used for backend communication:

db01 resolves to MySQL IP

mc01 resolves to Memcached IP

rmq01 resolves to RabbitMQ IP

This avoids hardcoding IP addresses and improves maintainability.
